this is a change i am trying to stage
idk if this will work or not

second change - my current book I am re-reading is Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen since my boyfriend gifted me a new one with a nicer cover than my previous one.

I love the movie with keira knightly despite the fact that it isn't accurate to the book and is definitely more drama, simply because I feel that the movie sets up scenes much nicer and with great tension and chemistry between the actors.
